# GUI Arithmetic Calculator

## Overview

This project is a simple GUI calculator built with Python's `tkinter` library. It's designed to perform basic arithmetic operations including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The calculator supports the use of parentheses to define the order of operations in calculations.

## Features

- **Basic Arithmetic Operations**: Perform addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (×), and division (÷).
- **Parentheses Support**: Use parentheses to specify the order of operations, allowing for more complex calculations.
- **Clear and Backspace**: Easily correct mistakes with clear (C) and backspace (<=) buttons.
- **Interactive GUI**: A user-friendly interface with buttons for each digit, operation, and function.

## Interface Layout

The calculator's GUI is intuitively designed, featuring:
- A display area for the current formula and the result.
- Buttons for digits (0 through 9), arithmetic operations (+, -, ×, ÷), parentheses (() and )), a decimal point (.), and equals (=) for performing the calculation.
- A clear (C) button to reset the calculation, and a backspace (<=) button to correct entries.
